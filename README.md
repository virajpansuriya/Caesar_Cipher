# Cybersecurity Internship Projects at Prodigy

This repository contains the projects I completed during my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy. Each project demonstrates a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity, ranging from cryptography and password security to keylogging and network packet analysis. Below is a brief overview of each project included in this repository:

## Projects Overview

### 1. Caesar Cipher
- *Description:* Implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. This project includes both encryption and decryption functionalities.
- *Technologies:* Python
- *Skills:* Cryptography, String manipulation

### 2. Pixel Manipulation
- *Description:* A program to manipulate image pixels for steganography purposes. This project demonstrates how to embed and extract hidden messages within image files.
- *Technologies:* Python, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- *Skills:* Steganography, Image processing

### 3. Password Strength Checker
- *Description:* A tool to evaluate the strength of a given password based on various criteria such as length, character diversity, and common patterns. It provides feedback and suggestions for improving password security.
- *Technologies:* Python
- *Skills:* Password security, Regular expressions

### 4. Keylogger
- *Description:* Development of a keylogger for educational purposes, showcasing how keylogging works and how it can be detected and prevented. This project logs keystrokes and saves them to a file.
- *Technologies:* Python
- *Skills:* Ethical hacking, Security awareness

### 5. Network Packet Analyzer
- *Description:* A network packet analyzer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. This project helps in understanding network protocols and monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities.
- *Technologies:* Python, Scapy
- *Skills:* Network security, Packet analysis

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you can clone this repository and run the scripts using Python. Each project is contained within its own directory with a README file providing detailed instructions on how to use and understand the code.

bash
git clone https://github.com/virajpansuriya/PRODIGYINFOTECH_CS_TASKS


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional libraries as listed in each project's README file
